                TL;DR I made this website with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via Brackets. I also used and adapted code/components from W3Schools and CodePen. I began my website with <a class="b text-links" href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-static-portfolio-with-advanced-css-bar-chart--cms-33050" target="_blank">this base and tutorial</a> by <a class="text-links" href="https://georgemartsoukos.com/" target="_blank">George Martsoukos</a>. I hosted the site via GitHub Pages and bought the domain from Google Domains.
                <br><br>
                I began the development of this website during my mid-semester holidays this year; about two months ago now.
                I have previously created two basic websites for a class in my Interaction Design minor, where I learnt HTML, CSS, and basic web design. I also learnt JavaScript in another class in this minor, where I made games such as Widow Mirror in the language. I applied what I learnt in these classes and found out much more to create this site.
                <br><br>
                At this stage in development, some parts of me regret creating the website near-completely custom, where it has given me a lot of freedom at the cost of much more work than necessary. Generally it's never a good idea to re-invent the wheel as a developer, especially since gaining web experience isn't something that means much to me. Using a template could have accomplished 90% of the things I have on this website and it would have taken 20% of the time. However, I have found the freedom refreshing, without websites bugging me about their free trials or being frustrated that the software wouldn't let me make a tiny adjustment. 
                <br><br>I also streamlined my development by applying good programming practice with many reusable classes and colour variables that allowed me to try different colour themes quickly. I used GitHub pages to host the site, so applying updates was as easy as pushing my changes to a GitHub repository. Updating the repo allowed me to quickly test changes on different browsers and seek feedback. Brackets also has Live Preview software allowing me to see minor changes even more immediately.    
                <br><br>
                Overall, creating this website was a great experience and it is turning out much better than expected. I am glad that I won't lose it as I have physical files and a repository, so I look forward to continually add my work experience to this blog throughout my career. I wonder what it would look like in 5 years if I keep adding to it. 
                Thanks for reading and I will leave you with a quote:

        This is my first blog post ever as a developer! I am currently working on this website, I have started the design of "Project Laserhand," and I am in the third quarter of BEEP's Adventure's development. 
        <br><br>I have already created a weekly blog for BEEP's Adventure and I will continue adding to this, which I will simply link in a google document. My plans for this blog are to log the development of Project Laserhand and I will do a brief post about how I made this website.
