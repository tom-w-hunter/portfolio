          Magentus is a global health technology company who provides clinical
          systems, practice management software and health informatics. I have
          worked here for over 2 years on their oncology application "Charm
          Evolution."

          I've been a part of the team to migrate our existing localised desktop
          application to a server-hosted web application. I've been working on
          migrating features, implementing new features, and fixing any defects
          that arise.
